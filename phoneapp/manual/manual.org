The '*Browse database*' option allows the user to view all the data contained in the pharmaceutical database. It will be discussed in a separate topic.

The application keeps a local database of pharmaceutical information. This database has to be kept up to date with the most recent changes in the information. The '*Synchronize database*' option will synchronize the local database to the central database through the Internet. Make sure to synchronize often when an Internet connection is available.

The '*Reset database*' will clear the local database of all data. A subsequent synchronization will fill the database up again. This option is useful if the local database has become corrupt, and should only be used if the data seems inaccurate, or the application gives unexpected errors.

*** Browse database
Upon selection of the '*Browse database*' option from the main menu the following screen will appear.
